Architecture Decision Record (ADR) - Cubic Flutter Assessment
1. Data Security (Encryption at Rest):
Choice: Hive with AES Encryption + Flutter Secure Storage.
Reason: To satisfy the requirement that data remains unreadable even on rooted devices. The encryption key is generated via Hive.generateSecureKey() and stored in the device's hardware-backed KeyStore/Keychain using FlutterSecureStorage.
2. High Performance (Large Dataset Processing):
Choice: Dart Isolates (compute function).
Reason: Processing 10,000+ JSON objects (4MB+) and calculating geographical distances (Haversine formula) on the main thread causes UI jank. By offloading parsing and filtering to background Isolates, we maintain a smooth 60fps experience.
3. Map Visualization:
Choice: Nearest 50 Filtering.
Reason: Rendering 10,000 markers on Google Maps significantly degrades performance. We implemented a distance-based sort to only show the relevant 50 locations to the user.
4. State Management:
Choice: Flutter BLoC/Cubit.
Reason: Provides a clean separation between UI and business logic, which is essential for a scalable and testable banking application.
